It doesn't take long to find what you're looking for. A silver key, as beautiful as it is shiny, is sitting on the
sidewalk behind a lamppost. Its bright light, previously hidden, now shines directly into your eyes. You feel a need
to sit down, but you don't, as there is nowhere to sit and the ground is wet. Instead, you light a cigarette and lean
against the lamp post. It's surprisingly effective, although you know it doesn't really matter. (key name is silver key)

The silver key shines beautifully, illuminating its surroundings in a shimmering sheen. You stare at it for quite a while.

As you pick the key up, you feel a compulsion to put it on your neck. So you do. Nothing particularly bad
happens, fortunately.
