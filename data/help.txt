Right. You can write 'move [direction]' to move in a specific direction
(although this is quite limited right now), you can write 'search' to see what items you
can grab, you can write 'unlock [x]' to unlock a lock (tip: you'll have to write unlock house)
once you find the key. You can always write 'help' for help. Also, if you know the name of the item you want,
you may write 'grab [item_name]'. You can also drop the item by writing 'drop [item name]'.
You may also write 'look' to look around. You can see your items by typing 'inventory'.
You can quit by typing 'quit'.
