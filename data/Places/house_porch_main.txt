Standing on the porch of this disproportionate house, you feel alarmed at your spike in adrenaline and cortisol.
You aren't sure what's caused this, but, looking up, you can't help but feel small. The house seems to extend for
miles, while simultaneously being smaller than you had expected. You're confused, and you are restless. You've decided
that you're either going to go in, or leave, but you don't want to stay in this liminal space any longer. Interestingly,
although the west passage of the porch is broken in and impassable, the east side is untouched.
