On an empty sidewalk, you can see mist rising around you. It's night, and
there's a cool breeze about. You're not sure how you got here, but, you won't question it.
Stranger things have been happening lately. Your focus is drawn to a tall house, its
dimensions both obscured by the lack of light and by... well, you're not sure.
Around you is a dense forest, and you can hear growling and other
unsettling noises. The house lies to your north.

With the key gone, the sidewalk seems just a slight bit dimmer. It could be your imagination, though. You know it tends
to play tricks on you...
